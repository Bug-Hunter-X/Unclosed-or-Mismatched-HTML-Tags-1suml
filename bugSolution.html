<p>The solution is to carefully check your HTML code to ensure that all opening tags have correctly matching closing tags. For the example above, the corrected code is:</p> <pre><code> &lt;div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>Using a good code editor with syntax highlighting and validation can help you to avoid these types of errors. Many modern browsers also have developer tools that can help you to identify these types of errors.</p>
