# Unclosed or Mismatched HTML Tags

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: unclosed or mismatched tags.  This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior or even prevent the page from loading correctly. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected version.

## Problem

Mismatched or unclosed HTML tags can cause the browser to misinterpret the structure of the document.  This can result in incorrectly displayed content, unexpected layout changes, or even complete page failure.

## Solution

Carefully review your HTML code to ensure that all opening tags have corresponding closing tags and that they are correctly nested.  Tools like a code editor with syntax highlighting and validation can help catch these errors.
